#Definition 
**Addition** (usually signified by the [plus symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus_and_minus_signs#Plus_sign "Plus and minus signs"), +) is one of the four basic [operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_(mathematics) "Operation (mathematics)") of [arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic "Arithmetic"), the other three being [subtraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtraction "Subtraction"), [multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication "Multiplication"), and [division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_(mathematics) "Division (mathematics)").<sup id="cite_ref-2" data-immersive-translate-walked="e687fc11-8d08-4713-893e-3c59e5bebce0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-2" pcked="1"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> The addition of two [whole numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number "Natural number") results in the total or _[sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summation "Summation")_ of those values combined. For example, the adjacent image shows two columns of apples, one with three apples and the other with two apples, totaling to five apples. This observation is expressed as "3 + 2 = 5", which is read as "three plus two [equals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equality_(mathematics) "Equality (mathematics)") five".

Besides [counting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting "Counting") items, addition can also be defined and executed without referring to [concrete objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_object "Concrete object"), using abstractions called [numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number "Number") instead, such as [integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer "Integer"), [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number"), and [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number"). Addition belongs to arithmetic, a branch of [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"). In [algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra "Algebra"), another area of mathematics, addition can also be performed on abstract objects such as [vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector "Euclidean vector"), [matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics) "Matrix (mathematics)"), [subspaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_subspace "Linear subspace"), and [subgroups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgroup "Subgroup").

Addition has several important properties. It is [commutative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_property "Commutative property"), meaning that the order of the [numbers being added](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operand "Operand") does not matter, so 3 + 2 = 2 + 3, and it is [associative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associativity "Associativity"), meaning that when one adds more than two numbers, the order in which addition is performed does not matter. Repeated addition of [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_(number) "1 (number)") is the same as counting (see [Successor function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Successor_function "Successor function")). Addition of [0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0_(number) "0 (number)") does not change a number. Addition also obeys rules concerning related operations such as subtraction and multiplication.

Performing addition is one of the simplest numerical tasks to perform. Addition of very small numbers is accessible to toddlers; the most basic task, 1 + 1, can be performed by infants as young as five months, and even some members of other animal species. In [primary education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education "Primary education"), students are taught to add numbers in the [decimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal "Decimal") system, beginning with single digits and progressively tackling more difficult problems. Mechanical aids range from the ancient [abacus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abacus "Abacus") to the modern [computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer "Computer"), where research on the most efficient implementations of addition continues to this day.

The plus sign

Addition is written using the [plus sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus_and_minus_signs "Plus and minus signs") "+" between the terms;<sup id="cite_ref-3" data-immersive-translate-walked="e687fc11-8d08-4713-893e-3c59e5bebce0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-3" pcked="1"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> that is, in [infix notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation "Infix notation"). The result is expressed with an [equals sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equals_sign "Equals sign"). For example,

![{\displaystyle 1+2=3}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/43f7e9a80913b9d5ec8d169140265d3e2fff5b4b) ("one plus two equals three")

Columnar addition – the numbers in the column are to be added, with the sum written below the [underlined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underline "Underline") number.

There are also situations where addition is "understood", even though no symbol appears:

-   A whole number followed immediately by a [fraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics) "Fraction (mathematics)") indicates the sum of the two, called a _mixed number_.<sup id="cite_ref-4" data-immersive-translate-walked="e687fc11-8d08-4713-893e-3c59e5bebce0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-4" pcked="1"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> For example,![{\displaystyle 3{\frac {1}{2}}=3+{\frac {1}{2}}=3.5.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/199813f9a9147385108fa968376b646f955d1bdc) This notation can cause confusion, since in most other contexts, [juxtaposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juxtaposition#Mathematics "Juxtaposition") denotes [multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication "Multiplication") instead.<sup id="cite_ref-5" data-immersive-translate-walked="e687fc11-8d08-4713-893e-3c59e5bebce0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-5" pcked="1"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>

The sum of a [series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_(mathematics) "Series (mathematics)") of related numbers can be expressed through [capital sigma notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_sigma_notation "Capital sigma notation"), which compactly denotes [iteration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteration "Iteration"). For example,

![{\displaystyle \sum _{k=1}^{5}k^{2}=1^{2}+2^{2}+3^{2}+4^{2}+5^{2}=55.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/436c5b2ec96a51551204f245aa03452c9e7616ae)

This is to be distinguished from _factors_, which are [multiplied](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication "Multiplication"). Some authors call the first addend the _augend_.<sup id="cite_ref-Shmerko_7-1" data-immersive-translate-walked="e687fc11-8d08-4713-893e-3c59e5bebce0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-Shmerko-7" pcked="1"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Schmid_1974_8-1" data-immersive-translate-walked="e687fc11-8d08-4713-893e-3c59e5bebce0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-Schmid_1974-8" pcked="1"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:1_9-1" data-immersive-translate-walked="e687fc11-8d08-4713-893e-3c59e5bebce0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-:1-9" pcked="1"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> In fact, during the [Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance "Renaissance"), many authors did not consider the first addend an "addend" at all. Today, due to the [commutative property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_property "Commutative property") of addition, "augend" is rarely used, and both terms are generally called addends.<sup id="cite_ref-Schwartzman_p._19_11-0" data-immersive-translate-walked="e687fc11-8d08-4713-893e-3c59e5bebce0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-Schwartzman_p._19-11" pcked="1"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup>

All of the above terminology derives from [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin"). "[Addition](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/addition "wikt:addition")" and "[add](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/add "wikt:add")" are [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language "English language") words derived from the Latin [verb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verb "Verb") _addere_, which is in turn a [compound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_(linguistics) "Compound (linguistics)") of _ad_ "to" and _dare_ "to give", from the [Proto-Indo-European root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_root "Proto-Indo-European root") _\*deh₃-_ "to give"; thus to _add_ is to _give to_.<sup id="cite_ref-Schwartzman_p._19_11-1" data-immersive-translate-walked="e687fc11-8d08-4713-893e-3c59e5bebce0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-Schwartzman_p._19-11" pcked="1"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> Using the [gerundive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerundive "Gerundive") [suffix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affix "Affix") _\-nd_ results in "addend", "thing to be added".<sup id="cite_ref-12" data-immersive-translate-walked="e687fc11-8d08-4713-893e-3c59e5bebce0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-12" pcked="1"><span>[</span>a<span>]</span></a></sup> Likewise from _augere_ "to increase", one gets "augend", "thing to be increased".

"Sum" and "summand" derive from the Latin [noun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun "Noun") _summa_ "the highest, the top" and associated verb _summare_. This is appropriate not only because the sum of two positive numbers is greater than either, but because it was common for the [ancient Greeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece "Ancient Greece") and [Romans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome "Ancient Rome") to add upward, contrary to the modern practice of adding downward, so that a sum was literally at the top of the addends.<sup id="cite_ref-14" data-immersive-translate-walked="e687fc11-8d08-4713-893e-3c59e5bebce0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-14" pcked="1"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> _Addere_ and _summare_ date back at least to [Boethius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anicius_Manlius_Severinus_Boethius "Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius"), if not to earlier Roman writers such as [Vitruvius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitruvius "Vitruvius") and [Frontinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sextus_Julius_Frontinus "Sextus Julius Frontinus"); Boethius also used several other terms for the addition operation. The later [Middle English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_English "Middle English") terms "adden" and "adding" were popularized by [Chaucer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Chaucer "Geoffrey Chaucer").<sup id="cite_ref-15" data-immersive-translate-walked="e687fc11-8d08-4713-893e-3c59e5bebce0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-15" pcked="1"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup>

Addition is used to model many physical processes. Even for the simple case of adding [natural numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number "Natural number"), there are many possible interpretations and even more visual representations.

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/AdditionShapes.svg/250px-AdditionShapes.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:AdditionShapes.svg)

One set has 3 shapes while the other set has 2. The total of shapes is 5, which is a consequence of the addition of the objects from the two sets (3 + 2 = 5).

Possibly the most basic interpretation of addition lies in combining [sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics) "Set (mathematics)"):

-   When two or more disjoint collections are combined into a single collection, the number of objects in the single collection is the sum of the numbers of objects in the original collections.

This interpretation is easy to visualize, with little danger of ambiguity. It is also useful in higher mathematics (for the rigorous definition it inspires, see [§ Natural numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#Natural_numbers) below). However, it is not obvious how one should extend this version of addition to include fractional numbers or negative numbers.<sup id="cite_ref-18" data-immersive-translate-walked="e687fc11-8d08-4713-893e-3c59e5bebce0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-18" pcked="1"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup>

One possible fix is to consider collections of objects that can be easily divided, such as pies or, still better, segmented rods.<sup id="cite_ref-19" data-immersive-translate-walked="e687fc11-8d08-4713-893e-3c59e5bebce0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-19" pcked="1"><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup> Rather than solely combining collections of segments, rods can be joined end-to-end, which illustrates another conception of addition: adding not the rods but the lengths of the rods.

A number-line visualization of the algebraic addition 2 + 4 = 6. A "jump" that has a distance of 2 followed by another that is long as 4, is the same as a translation by 6.

A number-line visualization of the unary addition 2 + 4 = 6. A translation by 4 is equivalent to four translations by 1.

A second interpretation of addition comes from extending an initial length by a given length:

-   When an original length is extended by a given amount, the final length is the sum of the original length and the length of the extension.<sup id="cite_ref-20" data-immersive-translate-walked="e687fc11-8d08-4713-893e-3c59e5bebce0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-20" pcked="1"><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup>

The sum _a_ + _b_ can be interpreted as a [binary operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_operation "Binary operation") that combines _a_ and _b_, in an algebraic sense, or it can be interpreted as the addition of _b_ more units to _a_. Under the latter interpretation, the parts of a sum _a_ + _b_ play asymmetric roles, and the operation _a_ + _b_ is viewed as applying the [unary operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unary_operation "Unary operation") +_b_ to _a_.<sup id="cite_ref-21" data-immersive-translate-walked="e687fc11-8d08-4713-893e-3c59e5bebce0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-21" pcked="1"><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup> Instead of calling both _a_ and _b_ addends, it is more appropriate to call _a_ the **augend** in this case, since _a_ plays a passive role. The unary view is also useful when discussing [subtraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtraction "Subtraction"), because each unary addition operation has an inverse unary subtraction operation, and _vice versa_.

4 + 2 = 2 + 4 with blocks

Addition is [commutative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative "Commutative"), meaning that one can change the order of the terms in a sum, but still get the same result. Symbolically, if _a_ and _b_ are any two numbers, then

_a_ + _b_ = _b_ + _a_.

The fact that addition is commutative is known as the "commutative law of addition" or "commutative property of addition". Some other [binary operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_operation "Binary operation"), such as multiplication, are commutative too, but there are others, such as subtraction and division, which are not.

2 + (1 + 3) = (2 + 1) + 3 with segmented rods

Addition is [associative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associativity "Associativity"), which means that when three or more numbers are added together, the [order of operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations "Order of operations") does not change the result.

As an example, should the expression _a_ + _b_ + _c_ be defined to mean (_a_ + _b_) + _c_ or _a_ + (_b_ + _c_)? Given that addition is associative, the choice of definition is irrelevant. For any three numbers _a_, _b_, and _c_, it is true that (_a_ + _b_) + _c_ = _a_ + (_b_ + _c_). For example, (1 + 2) + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6 = 1 + 5 = 1 + (2 + 3).

When addition is used together with other operations, the [order of operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations "Order of operations") becomes important. In the standard order of operations, addition is a lower priority than [exponentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation "Exponentiation"), [nth roots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nth_root "Nth root"), multiplication and division, but is given equal priority to subtraction.<sup id="cite_ref-22" data-immersive-translate-walked="e687fc11-8d08-4713-893e-3c59e5bebce0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-22" pcked="1"><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup>

5 + 0 = 5 with bags of dots

Adding [zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0_(number) "0 (number)") to any number, does not change the number; this means that zero is the [identity element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_element "Identity element") for addition, and is also known as the [additive identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_identity "Additive identity"). In symbols, for every _a_, one has

_a_ + 0 = 0 + _a_ = _a_.

This law was first identified in [Brahmagupta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmagupta "Brahmagupta")'s _[Brahmasphutasiddhanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmasphutasiddhanta "Brahmasphutasiddhanta")_ in 628 AD, although he wrote it as three separate laws, depending on whether _a_ is negative, positive, or zero itself, and he used words rather than algebraic symbols. Later [Indian mathematicians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_mathematicians "Indian mathematicians") refined the concept; around the year 830, [Mahavira](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahavira_(mathematician) "Mahavira (mathematician)") wrote, "zero becomes the same as what is added to it", corresponding to the unary statement 0 + _a_ = _a_. In the 12th century, [Bhaskara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bh%C4%81skara_II "Bhāskara II") wrote, "In the addition of cipher, or subtraction of it, the quantity, positive or negative, remains the same", corresponding to the unary statement _a_ + 0 = _a_.<sup id="cite_ref-23" data-immersive-translate-walked="e687fc11-8d08-4713-893e-3c59e5bebce0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-23" pcked="1"><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup>

Within the context of integers, addition of [one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_(number) "1 (number)") also plays a special role: for any integer _a_, the integer (_a_ + 1) is the least integer greater than _a_, also known as the [successor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Successor_function "Successor function") of _a_.<sup id="cite_ref-24" data-immersive-translate-walked="e687fc11-8d08-4713-893e-3c59e5bebce0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-24" pcked="1"><span>[</span>23<span>]</span></a></sup> For instance, 3 is the successor of 2 and 7 is the successor of 6. Because of this succession, the value of _a_ + _b_ can also be seen as the _b_th successor of _a_, making addition iterated succession. For example, 6 + 2 is 8, because 8 is the successor of 7, which is the successor of 6, making 8 the 2nd successor of 6.

To numerically add physical quantities with [units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement "Units of measurement"), they must be expressed with common units.<sup id="cite_ref-25" data-immersive-translate-walked="e687fc11-8d08-4713-893e-3c59e5bebce0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-25" pcked="1"><span>[</span>24<span>]</span></a></sup> For example, adding 50 milliliters to 150 milliliters gives 200 milliliters. However, if a measure of 5 feet is extended by 2 inches, the sum is 62 inches, since 60 inches is synonymous with 5 feet. On the other hand, it is usually meaningless to try to add 3 meters and 4 square meters, since those units are incomparable; this sort of consideration is fundamental in [dimensional analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis "Dimensional analysis").<sup id="cite_ref-26" data-immersive-translate-walked="e687fc11-8d08-4713-893e-3c59e5bebce0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-26" pcked="1"><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup>

## Performing addition

\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Addition&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Performing addition")\]

Studies on mathematical development starting around the 1980s have exploited the phenomenon of [habituation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habituation "Habituation"): [infants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant "Infant") look longer at situations that are unexpected.<sup id="cite_ref-27" data-immersive-translate-walked="e687fc11-8d08-4713-893e-3c59e5bebce0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-27" pcked="1"><span>[</span>26<span>]</span></a></sup> A seminal experiment by [Karen Wynn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Wynn "Karen Wynn") in 1992 involving [Mickey Mouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Mouse "Mickey Mouse") dolls manipulated behind a screen demonstrated that five-month-old infants _expect_ 1 + 1 to be 2, and they are comparatively surprised when a physical situation seems to imply that 1 + 1 is either 1 or 3. This finding has since been affirmed by a variety of laboratories using different methodologies.<sup id="cite_ref-28" data-immersive-translate-walked="e687fc11-8d08-4713-893e-3c59e5bebce0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-28" pcked="1"><span>[</span>27<span>]</span></a></sup> Another 1992 experiment with older [toddlers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toddler "Toddler"), between 18 and 35 months, exploited their development of motor control by allowing them to retrieve [ping-pong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping-pong "Ping-pong") balls from a box; the youngest responded well for small numbers, while older subjects were able to compute sums up to 5.<sup id="cite_ref-29" data-immersive-translate-walked="e687fc11-8d08-4713-893e-3c59e5bebce0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-29" pcked="1"><span>[</span>28<span>]</span></a></sup>

Even some nonhuman animals show a limited ability to add, particularly [primates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primate "Primate"). In a 1995 experiment imitating Wynn's 1992 result (but using [eggplants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eggplant "Eggplant") instead of dolls), [rhesus macaque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhesus_macaque "Rhesus macaque") and [cottontop tamarin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cottontop_tamarin "Cottontop tamarin") monkeys performed similarly to human infants. More dramatically, after being taught the meanings of the [Arabic numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_numerals "Arabic numerals") 0 through 4, one [chimpanzee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Chimpanzee "Common Chimpanzee") was able to compute the sum of two numerals without further training.<sup id="cite_ref-30" data-immersive-translate-walked="e687fc11-8d08-4713-893e-3c59e5bebce0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-30" pcked="1"><span>[</span>29<span>]</span></a></sup> More recently, [Asian elephants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_elephant "Asian elephant") have demonstrated an ability to perform basic arithmetic.<sup id="cite_ref-31" data-immersive-translate-walked="e687fc11-8d08-4713-893e-3c59e5bebce0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-31" pcked="1"><span>[</span>30<span>]</span></a></sup>

Typically, children first master [counting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting "Counting"). When given a problem that requires that two items and three items be combined, young children model the situation with physical objects, often fingers or a drawing, and then count the total. As they gain experience, they learn or discover the strategy of "counting-on": asked to find two plus three, children count three past two, saying "three, four, _five_" (usually ticking off fingers), and arriving at five. This strategy seems almost universal; children can easily pick it up from peers or teachers.<sup id="cite_ref-32" data-immersive-translate-walked="e687fc11-8d08-4713-893e-3c59e5bebce0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-32" pcked="1"><span>[</span>31<span>]</span></a></sup> Most discover it independently. With additional experience, children learn to add more quickly by exploiting the commutativity of addition by counting up from the larger number, in this case, starting with three and counting "four, _five_." Eventually children begin to recall certain addition facts ("[number bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_bond "Number bond")"), either through experience or rote memorization. Once some facts are committed to memory, children begin to derive unknown facts from known ones. For example, a child asked to add six and seven may know that 6 + 6 = 12 and then reason that 6 + 7 is one more, or 13.<sup id="cite_ref-33" data-immersive-translate-walked="e687fc11-8d08-4713-893e-3c59e5bebce0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-33" pcked="1"><span>[</span>32<span>]</span></a></sup> Such derived facts can be found very quickly and most elementary school students eventually rely on a mixture of memorized and derived facts to add fluently.<sup id="cite_ref-Henry_34-0" data-immersive-translate-walked="e687fc11-8d08-4713-893e-3c59e5bebce0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-Henry-34" pcked="1"><span>[</span>33<span>]</span></a></sup>

Different nations introduce whole numbers and arithmetic at different ages, with many countries teaching addition in pre-school.<sup id="cite_ref-35" data-immersive-translate-walked="e687fc11-8d08-4713-893e-3c59e5bebce0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-35" pcked="1"><span>[</span>34<span>]</span></a></sup> However, throughout the world, addition is taught by the end of the first year of elementary school.<sup id="cite_ref-36" data-immersive-translate-walked="e687fc11-8d08-4713-893e-3c59e5bebce0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-36" pcked="1"><span>[</span>35<span>]</span></a></sup>

Children are often presented with the addition table of pairs of numbers from 0 to 9 to memorize.

| + | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |

The prerequisite to addition in the [decimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal "Decimal") system is the fluent recall or derivation of the 100 single-digit "addition facts". One could [memorize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorize "Memorize") all the facts by [rote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rote_learning "Rote learning"), but pattern-based strategies are more enlightening and, for most people, more efficient:<sup id="cite_ref-FosnotDolk99_37-0" data-immersive-translate-walked="e687fc11-8d08-4713-893e-3c59e5bebce0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-FosnotDolk99-37" pcked="1"><span>[</span>36<span>]</span></a></sup>

-   _Commutative property_: Mentioned above, using the pattern _a + b = b + a_ reduces the number of "addition facts" from 100 to 55.
-   _One or two more_: Adding 1 or 2 is a basic task, and it can be accomplished through counting on or, ultimately, [intuition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuition_(knowledge) "Intuition (knowledge)").<sup id="cite_ref-FosnotDolk99_37-1" data-immersive-translate-walked="e687fc11-8d08-4713-893e-3c59e5bebce0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-FosnotDolk99-37" pcked="1"><span>[</span>36<span>]</span></a></sup>
-   _Zero_: Since zero is the additive identity, adding zero is trivial. Nonetheless, in the teaching of arithmetic, some students are introduced to addition as a process that always increases the addends; [word problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_problem_(mathematics_education) "Word problem (mathematics education)") may help rationalize the "exception" of zero.<sup id="cite_ref-FosnotDolk99_37-2" data-immersive-translate-walked="e687fc11-8d08-4713-893e-3c59e5bebce0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-FosnotDolk99-37" pcked="1"><span>[</span>36<span>]</span></a></sup>
-   _Doubles_: Adding a number to itself is related to counting by two and to [multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication "Multiplication"). Doubles facts form a backbone for many related facts, and students find them relatively easy to grasp.<sup id="cite_ref-FosnotDolk99_37-3" data-immersive-translate-walked="e687fc11-8d08-4713-893e-3c59e5bebce0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-FosnotDolk99-37" pcked="1"><span>[</span>36<span>]</span></a></sup>
-   _Near-doubles_: Sums such as 6 + 7 = 13 can be quickly derived from the doubles fact 6 + 6 = 12 by adding one more, or from 7 + 7 = 14 but subtracting one.<sup id="cite_ref-FosnotDolk99_37-4" data-immersive-translate-walked="e687fc11-8d08-4713-893e-3c59e5bebce0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-FosnotDolk99-37" pcked="1"><span>[</span>36<span>]</span></a></sup>
-   _Five and ten_: Sums of the form 5 + x and 10 + x are usually memorized early and can be used for deriving other facts. For example, 6 + 7 = 13 can be derived from 5 + 7 = 12 by adding one more.<sup id="cite_ref-FosnotDolk99_37-5" data-immersive-translate-walked="e687fc11-8d08-4713-893e-3c59e5bebce0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-FosnotDolk99-37" pcked="1"><span>[</span>36<span>]</span></a></sup>
-   _Making ten_: An advanced strategy uses 10 as an intermediate for sums involving 8 or 9; for example, 8 + 6 = 8 + 2 + 4 = 10 + 4 = 14.<sup id="cite_ref-FosnotDolk99_37-6" data-immersive-translate-walked="e687fc11-8d08-4713-893e-3c59e5bebce0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-FosnotDolk99-37" pcked="1"><span>[</span>36<span>]</span></a></sup>

As students grow older, they commit more facts to memory, and learn to derive other facts rapidly and fluently. Many students never commit all the facts to memory, but can still find any basic fact quickly.<sup id="cite_ref-Henry_34-1" data-immersive-translate-walked="e687fc11-8d08-4713-893e-3c59e5bebce0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-Henry-34" pcked="1"><span>[</span>33<span>]</span></a></sup>

The standard algorithm for adding multidigit numbers is to align the addends vertically and add the columns, starting from the ones column on the right. If a column exceeds nine, the extra digit is "[carried](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carry_(arithmetic) "Carry (arithmetic)")" into the next column. For example, in the addition 27 + 59

```
  ¹
  27
+ 59
————
  86
```

7 + 9 = 16, and the digit 1 is the carry.<sup id="cite_ref-38"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-38" pcked="1"><span>[</span>b<span>]</span></a></sup> An alternate strategy starts adding from the most significant digit on the left; this route makes carrying a little clumsier, but it is faster at getting a rough estimate of the sum. There are many alternative methods.

Since the end of the 20th century, some US programs, including TERC, decided to remove the traditional transfer method from their curriculum.<sup id="cite_ref-39"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-39" pcked="1"><span>[</span>37<span>]</span></a></sup> This decision was criticized,<sup id="cite_ref-40"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-40" pcked="1"><span>[</span>38<span>]</span></a></sup> which is why some states and counties did not support this experiment.

[Decimal fractions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_fractions "Decimal fractions") can be added by a simple modification of the above process.<sup id="cite_ref-41"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-41" pcked="1"><span>[</span>39<span>]</span></a></sup> One aligns two decimal fractions above each other, with the decimal point in the same location. If necessary, one can add trailing zeros to a shorter decimal to make it the same length as the longer decimal. Finally, one performs the same addition process as above, except the decimal point is placed in the answer, exactly where it was placed in the summands.

As an example, 45.1 + 4.34 can be solved as follows:

```
   4 5 . 1 0
+  0 4 . 3 4
————————————
   4 9 . 4 4
```

#### Scientific notation

\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Addition&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Scientific notation")\]

In [scientific notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_notation "Scientific notation"), numbers are written in the form ![{\displaystyle x=a\times 10^{b}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7eea4aa2cfd766558bc1a03f0297b9e34521c293), where ![{\displaystyle a}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ffd2487510aa438433a2579450ab2b3d557e5edc) is the significand and ![{\displaystyle 10^{b}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d27d5434463417d4d6b12bf6c2835d270bd6b814) is the exponential part. Addition requires two numbers in scientific notation to be represented using the same exponential part, so that the two significands can simply be added.

For example:

![{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}&2.34\times 10^{-5}+5.67\times 10^{-6}\\&\quad =2.34\times 10^{-5}+0.567\times 10^{-5}\\&\quad =2.907\times 10^{-5}.\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e75fab741fc87cb367a83ec40b3806b76d7cb5bb)

Addition in other bases is very similar to decimal addition. As an example, one can consider addition in binary.<sup id="cite_ref-42"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-42" pcked="1"><span>[</span>40<span>]</span></a></sup> Adding two single-digit binary numbers is relatively simple, using a form of carrying:

0 + 0 → 0

0 + 1 → 1

1 + 0 → 1

1 + 1 → 0, carry 1 (since 1 + 1 = 2 = 0 + (1 × 2<sup>1</sup>))

Adding two "1" digits produces a digit "0", while 1 must be added to the next column. This is similar to what happens in decimal when certain single-digit numbers are added together; if the result equals or exceeds the value of the radix (10), the digit to the left is incremented:

5 + 5 → 0, carry 1 (since 5 + 5 = 10 = 0 + (1 × 10<sup>1</sup>))

7 + 9 → 6, carry 1 (since 7 + 9 = 16 = 6 + (1 × 10<sup>1</sup>))

This is known as _carrying_.<sup id="cite_ref-43"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-43" pcked="1"><span>[</span>41<span>]</span></a></sup> When the result of an addition exceeds the value of a digit, the procedure is to "carry" the excess amount divided by the radix (that is, 10/10) to the left, adding it to the next positional value. This is correct since the next position has a weight that is higher by a factor equal to the radix. Carrying works the same way in binary:

```
  <span>1 1 1 1 1    (carried digits)</span>
    0 1 1 0 1
+   1 0 1 1 1
—————————————
  1 0 0 1 0 0 = 36
```

In this example, two numerals are being added together: 01101<sub>2</sub> (13<sub>10</sub>) and 10111<sub>2</sub> (23<sub>10</sub>). The top row shows the carry bits used. Starting in the rightmost column, 1 + 1 = 10<sub>2</sub>. The 1 is carried to the left, and the 0 is written at the bottom of the rightmost column. The second column from the right is added: 1 + 0 + 1 = 10<sub>2</sub> again; the 1 is carried, and 0 is written at the bottom. The third column: 1 + 1 + 1 = 11<sub>2</sub>. This time, a 1 is carried, and a 1 is written in the bottom row. Proceeding like this gives the final answer 100100<sub>2</sub> (36<sub>10</sub>).

[Analog computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_computer "Analog computer") work directly with physical quantities, so their addition mechanisms depend on the form of the addends. A mechanical adder might represent two addends as the positions of sliding blocks, in which case they can be added with an [averaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean "Arithmetic mean") [lever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lever "Lever"). If the addends are the rotation speeds of two [shafts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axle "Axle"), they can be added with a [differential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(mechanics) "Differential (mechanics)"). A hydraulic adder can add the [pressures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure "Pressure") in two chambers by exploiting [Newton's second law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion "Newton's laws of motion") to balance forces on an assembly of [pistons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piston "Piston"). The most common situation for a general-purpose analog computer is to add two [voltages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage "Voltage") (referenced to [ground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_(electricity) "Ground (electricity)")); this can be accomplished roughly with a [resistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistor "Resistor") [network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_circuit "Electronic circuit"), but a better design exploits an [operational amplifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_amplifier "Operational amplifier").<sup id="cite_ref-44"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-44" pcked="1"><span>[</span>42<span>]</span></a></sup>

Addition is also fundamental to the operation of [digital computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer "Computer"), where the efficiency of addition, in particular the [carry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carry_(arithmetic) "Carry (arithmetic)") mechanism, is an important limitation to overall performance.

The [abacus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abacus "Abacus"), also called a counting frame, is a calculating tool that was in use centuries before the adoption of the written modern numeral system and is still widely used by merchants, traders and clerks in [Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia "Asia"), [Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa "Africa"), and elsewhere; it dates back to at least 2700–2300 BC, when it was used in [Sumer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumer "Sumer").<sup id="cite_ref-45"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-45" pcked="1"><span>[</span>43<span>]</span></a></sup>

[Pascal's calculator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_calculator "Pascal's calculator") was limited by its carry mechanism, which forced its wheels to only turn one way so it could add. To subtract, the operator had to use the [Pascal's calculator's complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_complements "Method of complements"), which required as many steps as an addition. [Giovanni Poleni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Poleni "Giovanni Poleni") followed Pascal, building the second functional mechanical calculator in 1709, a calculating clock made of wood that, once setup, could multiply two numbers automatically.

"[Full adder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adder_(electronics) "Adder (electronics)")" logic circuit that adds two binary digits, _A_ and _B_, along with a carry input _C<sub>in</sub>_, producing the sum bit, _S_, and a carry output, _C<sub>out</sub>_.

[Adders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adder_(electronics) "Adder (electronics)") execute integer addition in electronic digital computers, usually using [binary arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_arithmetic "Binary arithmetic"). The simplest architecture is the ripple carry adder, which follows the standard multi-digit algorithm. One slight improvement is the [carry skip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carry_bypass_adder "Carry bypass adder") design, again following human intuition; one does not perform all the carries in computing 999 + 1, but one bypasses the group of 9s and skips to the answer.<sup id="cite_ref-48"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-48" pcked="1"><span>[</span>46<span>]</span></a></sup>

In practice, computational addition may be achieved via [XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or "Exclusive or") and [AND](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#AND "Bitwise operation") bitwise logical operations in conjunction with bitshift operations as shown in the [pseudocode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode "Pseudocode") below. Both XOR and AND gates are straightforward to realize in digital logic allowing the realization of [full adder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adder_(electronics) "Adder (electronics)") circuits which in turn may be combined into more complex logical operations. In modern digital computers, integer addition is typically the fastest arithmetic instruction, yet it has the largest impact on performance, since it underlies all [floating-point operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic "Floating-point arithmetic") as well as such basic tasks as [address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_address "Memory address") generation during [memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_(computers) "Memory (computers)") access and fetching [instructions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_(computer_science) "Instruction (computer science)") during [branching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow "Control flow"). To increase speed, modern designs calculate digits in [parallel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_algorithm "Parallel algorithm"); these schemes go by such names as carry select, [carry lookahead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carry_lookahead_adder "Carry lookahead adder"), and the [Ling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ling_adder "Ling adder") pseudocarry. Many implementations are, in fact, hybrids of these last three designs.<sup id="cite_ref-49"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-49" pcked="1"><span>[</span>47<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-50"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-50" pcked="1"><span>[</span>48<span>]</span></a></sup> Unlike addition on paper, addition on a computer often changes the addends. On the ancient [abacus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abacus "Abacus") and adding board, both addends are destroyed, leaving only the sum. The influence of the abacus on mathematical thinking was strong enough that early [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin") texts often claimed that in the process of adding "a number to a number", both numbers vanish.<sup id="cite_ref-51"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-51" pcked="1"><span>[</span>49<span>]</span></a></sup> In modern times, the ADD instruction of a [microprocessor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microprocessor "Microprocessor") often replaces the augend with the sum but preserves the addend.<sup id="cite_ref-52"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-52" pcked="1"><span>[</span>50<span>]</span></a></sup> In a [high-level programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language "High-level programming language"), evaluating _a_ + _b_ does not change either _a_ or _b_; if the goal is to replace _a_ with the sum this must be explicitly requested, typically with the statement _a_ = _a_ + _b_. Some languages such as [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language) "C (programming language)") or [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B "C++") allow this to be abbreviated as _a_ += _b_.

On a computer, if the result of an addition is too large to store, an [arithmetic overflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_overflow "Arithmetic overflow") occurs, resulting in an incorrect answer. Unanticipated arithmetic overflow is a fairly common cause of [program errors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug "Software bug"). Such overflow bugs may be hard to discover and diagnose because they may manifest themselves only for very large input data sets, which are less likely to be used in validation tests.<sup id="cite_ref-53"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-53" pcked="1"><span>[</span>51<span>]</span></a></sup> The [Year 2000 problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2000_problem "Year 2000 problem") was a series of bugs where overflow errors occurred due to use of a 2-digit format for years.<sup id="cite_ref-54"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-54" pcked="1"><span>[</span>52<span>]</span></a></sup>

Computers have another way of representing numbers, called _[floating-point arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic "Floating-point arithmetic")_ which is similar to scientific notation described above and which reduces the overflow problem. Each floating point number has two parts, an exponent and a mantissa. To add two floating point numbers, the exponents must match, which typically means shifting the mantissa of the smaller number. If the disparity between the larger and smaller number is too great, a loss of precision may result. If many smaller number are to be added to a large number, it is best to add the smaller number together first and then add the total to the larger number, rather than adding small numbers to the large number one at a time. This makes floating point addition non-associative in general. See [floating-point arithmetic#Accuracy problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic#Accuracy_problems "Floating-point arithmetic").

## Addition of numbers

\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Addition&action=edit&section=22 "Edit section: Addition of numbers")\]

To prove the usual properties of addition, one must first define addition for the context in question. Addition is first defined on the [natural numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number "Natural number"). In [set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory "Set theory"), addition is then extended to progressively larger sets that include the natural numbers: the [integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer "Integer"), the [rational numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number "Rational number"), and the [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number").<sup id="cite_ref-55"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-55" pcked="1"><span>[</span>53<span>]</span></a></sup> (In [mathematics education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics_education "Mathematics education"),<sup id="cite_ref-56"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-56" pcked="1"><span>[</span>54<span>]</span></a></sup> positive fractions are added before negative numbers are even considered; this is also the historical route.<sup id="cite_ref-57"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-57" pcked="1"><span>[</span>55<span>]</span></a></sup>)

There are two popular ways to define the sum of two natural numbers _a_ and _b_. If one defines natural numbers to be the [cardinalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_number "Cardinal number") of finite sets, (the cardinality of a set is the number of elements in the set), then it is appropriate to define their sum as follows:

-   Let N(_S_) be the cardinality of a set _S_. Take two disjoint sets _A_ and _B_, with N(_A_) = _a_ and N(_B_) = _b_. Then _a_ + _b_ is defined as ![{\displaystyle N(A\cup B)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3facc2fbd8e65e33a64e9da652db03fcbda1fca7).<sup id="cite_ref-58"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-58" pcked="1"><span>[</span>56<span>]</span></a></sup>

Here, _A_ ∪ _B_ is the [union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(set_theory) "Union (set theory)") of _A_ and _B_. An alternate version of this definition allows _A_ and _B_ to possibly overlap and then takes their [disjoint union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint_union "Disjoint union"), a mechanism that allows common elements to be separated out and therefore counted twice.

The other popular definition is recursive:

-   Let _n_<sup>+</sup> be the successor of _n_, that is the number following _n_ in the natural numbers, so 0<sup>+</sup> = 1, 1<sup>+</sup> = 2. Define _a_ + 0 = _a_. Define the general sum recursively by _a_ + (_b_<sup>+</sup>) = (_a_ + _b_)<sup>+</sup>. Hence 1 + 1 = 1 + 0<sup>+</sup> = (1 + 0)<sup>+</sup> = 1<sup>+</sup> = 2.<sup id="cite_ref-59"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-59" pcked="1"><span>[</span>57<span>]</span></a></sup>

Again, there are minor variations upon this definition in the literature. Taken literally, the above definition is an application of the [recursion theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion#The_recursion_theorem "Recursion") on the [partially ordered set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set "Partially ordered set") **N**<sup>2</sup>.<sup id="cite_ref-60"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-60" pcked="1"><span>[</span>58<span>]</span></a></sup> On the other hand, some sources prefer to use a restricted recursion theorem that applies only to the set of natural numbers. One then considers _a_ to be temporarily "fixed", applies recursion on _b_ to define a function "_a_ +", and pastes these unary operations for all _a_ together to form the full binary operation.<sup id="cite_ref-61"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-61" pcked="1"><span>[</span>59<span>]</span></a></sup>

This recursive formulation of addition was developed by Dedekind as early as 1854, and he would expand upon it in the following decades.<sup id="cite_ref-62"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-62" pcked="1"><span>[</span>60<span>]</span></a></sup> He proved the associative and commutative properties, among others, through [mathematical induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_induction "Mathematical induction").

The simplest conception of an integer is that it consists of an [absolute value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_value "Absolute value") (which is a natural number) and a [sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_(mathematics) "Sign (mathematics)") (generally either [positive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_number "Positive number") or [negative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_numbers "Negative numbers")). The integer zero is a special third case, being neither positive nor negative. The corresponding definition of addition must proceed by cases:

-   For an integer _n_, let |_n_| be its absolute value. Let _a_ and _b_ be integers. If either _a_ or _b_ is zero, treat it as an identity. If _a_ and _b_ are both positive, define _a_ + _b_ = |_a_| + |_b_|. If _a_ and _b_ are both negative, define _a_ + _b_ = −(|_a_| + |_b_|). If _a_ and _b_ have different signs, define _a_ + _b_ to be the difference between |_a_| and |_b_|, with the sign of the term whose absolute value is larger.<sup id="cite_ref-63"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-63" pcked="1"><span>[</span>61<span>]</span></a></sup> As an example, −6 + 4 = −2; because −6 and 4 have different signs, their absolute values are subtracted, and since the absolute value of the negative term is larger, the answer is negative.

Although this definition can be useful for concrete problems, the number of cases to consider complicates proofs unnecessarily. So the following method is commonly used for defining integers. It is based on the remark that every integer is the difference of two natural integers and that two such differences, _a_ – _b_ and _c_ – _d_ are equal if and only if _a_ + _d_ = _b_ + _c_. So, one can define formally the integers as the [equivalence classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_class "Equivalence class") of [ordered pairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_pair "Ordered pair") of natural numbers under the [equivalence relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation "Equivalence relation")

(_a_, _b_) ~ (_c_, _d_) if and only if _a_ + _d_ = _b_ + _c_.

The equivalence class of (_a_, _b_) contains either (_a_ – _b_, 0) if _a_ ≥ _b_, or (0, _b_ – _a_) otherwise. If n is a natural number, one can denote +_n_ the equivalence class of (_n_, 0), and by –_n_ the equivalence class of (0, _n_). This allows identifying the natural number n with the equivalence class +_n_.

Addition of ordered pairs is done component-wise:

![{\displaystyle (a,b)+(c,d)=(a+c,b+d).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/761b0f61125da79545791e95c0bf1a777d49271a)

A straightforward computation shows that the equivalence class of the result depends only on the equivalences classes of the summands, and thus that this defines an addition of equivalence classes, that is integers.<sup id="cite_ref-64"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-64" pcked="1"><span>[</span>62<span>]</span></a></sup> Another straightforward computation shows that this addition is the same as the above case definition.

This way of defining integers as equivalence classes of pairs of natural numbers, can be used to embed into a [group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics) "Group (mathematics)") any commutative [semigroup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semigroup "Semigroup") with [cancellation property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancellation_property "Cancellation property"). Here, the semigroup is formed by the natural numbers and the group is the additive group of integers. The rational numbers are constructed similarly, by taking as semigroup the nonzero integers with multiplication.

This construction has been also generalized under the name of [Grothendieck group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grothendieck_group "Grothendieck group") to the case of any commutative semigroup. Without the cancellation property the [semigroup homomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semigroup_homomorphism "Semigroup homomorphism") from the semigroup into the group may be non-injective. Originally, the _Grothendieck group_ was, more specifically, the result of this construction applied to the equivalences classes under isomorphisms of the objects of an [abelian category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_category "Abelian category"), with the [direct sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_sum "Direct sum") as semigroup operation.

### Rational numbers (fractions)

\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Addition&action=edit&section=25 "Edit section: Rational numbers (fractions)")\]

Addition of [rational numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number "Rational number") can be computed using the [least common denominator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_common_denominator "Least common denominator"), but a conceptually simpler definition involves only integer addition and multiplication:

-   Define ![{\displaystyle {\frac {a}{b}}+{\frac {c}{d}}={\frac {ad+bc}{bd}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0eecabb202924505dec89443299735337cd84d6f)

As an example, the sum ![{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{4}}+{\frac {1}{8}}={\frac {3\times 8+4\times 1}{4\times 8}}={\frac {24+4}{32}}={\frac {28}{32}}={\frac {7}{8}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/21a47f45cf2c04a20dde58bf348c882bb557d44f).

Addition of fractions is much simpler when the [denominators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denominator "Denominator") are the same; in this case, one can simply add the numerators while leaving the denominator the same: ![{\displaystyle {\frac {a}{c}}+{\frac {b}{c}}={\frac {a+b}{c}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ea35d64b428f437485bb7ea2fdb5a67db99f58a6), so ![{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{4}}+{\frac {2}{4}}={\frac {1+2}{4}}={\frac {3}{4}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/97a263fa03c2c24ca515461b017115a414ee6db5).<sup id="cite_ref-65"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-65" pcked="1"><span>[</span>63<span>]</span></a></sup>

The commutativity and associativity of rational addition is an easy consequence of the laws of integer arithmetic.<sup id="cite_ref-66"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-66" pcked="1"><span>[</span>64<span>]</span></a></sup> For a more rigorous and general discussion, see _[field of fractions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_of_fractions "Field of fractions")_.

A common construction of the set of real numbers is the Dedekind completion of the set of rational numbers. A real number is defined to be a [Dedekind cut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedekind_cut "Dedekind cut") of rationals: a [non-empty set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-empty_set "Non-empty set") of rationals that is closed downward and has no [greatest element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_element "Greatest element"). The sum of real numbers _a_ and _b_ is defined element by element:

-   Define ![{\displaystyle a+b=\{q+r\mid q\in a,r\in b\}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/531e0e6bfbb98e62badfd8f0a43f101a3e36b121)<sup id="cite_ref-67"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-67" pcked="1"><span>[</span>65<span>]</span></a></sup>

This definition was first published, in a slightly modified form, by [Richard Dedekind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dedekind "Richard Dedekind") in 1872.<sup id="cite_ref-68"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-68" pcked="1"><span>[</span>66<span>]</span></a></sup> The commutativity and associativity of real addition are immediate; defining the real number 0 to be the set of negative rationals, it is easily seen to be the additive identity. Probably the trickiest part of this construction pertaining to addition is the definition of additive inverses.<sup id="cite_ref-69"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-69" pcked="1"><span>[</span>67<span>]</span></a></sup>

Adding π<sup>2</sup>/6 and _e_ using Cauchy sequences of rationals.

Unfortunately, dealing with multiplication of Dedekind cuts is a time-consuming case-by-case process similar to the addition of signed integers.<sup id="cite_ref-70"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-70" pcked="1"><span>[</span>68<span>]</span></a></sup> Another approach is the metric completion of the rational numbers. A real number is essentially defined to be the limit of a [Cauchy sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_sequence "Cauchy sequence") of rationals, lim _a_<sub><i>n</i></sub>. Addition is defined term by term:

-   Define ![{\displaystyle \lim _{n}a_{n}+\lim _{n}b_{n}=\lim _{n}(a_{n}+b_{n}).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7ec423c31d7c209581774bb54bf6275ba546101e)<sup id="cite_ref-71"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-71" pcked="1"><span>[</span>69<span>]</span></a></sup>

This definition was first published by [Georg Cantor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor "Georg Cantor"), also in 1872, although his formalism was slightly different.<sup id="cite_ref-72"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-72" pcked="1"><span>[</span>70<span>]</span></a></sup> One must prove that this operation is well-defined, dealing with co-Cauchy sequences. Once that task is done, all the properties of real addition follow immediately from the properties of rational numbers. Furthermore, the other arithmetic operations, including multiplication, have straightforward, analogous definitions.<sup id="cite_ref-73"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-73" pcked="1"><span>[</span>71<span>]</span></a></sup>

Addition of two complex numbers can be done geometrically by constructing a parallelogram.

Complex numbers are added by adding the real and imaginary parts of the summands.<sup id="cite_ref-74"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-74" pcked="1"><span>[</span>72<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-75"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-75" pcked="1"><span>[</span>73<span>]</span></a></sup> That is to say:

![{\displaystyle (a+bi)+(c+di)=(a+c)+(b+d)i.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e7a659c86589cad841e37da3ce64af337ed5caab)

Using the visualization of complex numbers in the complex plane, the addition has the following geometric interpretation: the sum of two complex numbers _A_ and _B_, interpreted as points of the complex plane, is the point _X_ obtained by building a [parallelogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallelogram "Parallelogram") three of whose vertices are _O_, _A_ and _B_. Equivalently, _X_ is the point such that the [triangles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle "Triangle") with vertices _O_, _A_, _B_, and _X_, _B_, _A_, are [congruent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congruence_(geometry) "Congruence (geometry)").

There are many binary operations that can be viewed as generalizations of the addition operation on the real numbers. The field of [abstract algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_algebra "Abstract algebra") is centrally concerned with such generalized operations, and they also appear in [set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory "Set theory") and [category theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory "Category theory").

In [linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra "Linear algebra"), a [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space") is an algebraic structure that allows for adding any two [vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_vector "Coordinate vector") and for scaling vectors. A familiar vector space is the set of all ordered pairs of real numbers; the ordered pair (_a_,_b_) is interpreted as a vector from the origin in the Euclidean plane to the point (_a_,_b_) in the plane. The sum of two vectors is obtained by adding their individual coordinates:

![{\displaystyle (a,b)+(c,d)=(a+c,b+d).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/761b0f61125da79545791e95c0bf1a777d49271a)

This addition operation is central to [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics"), in which [velocities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity "Velocity"), [accelerations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration "Acceleration") and [forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force "Force") are all represented by vectors.<sup id="cite_ref-76"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-76" pcked="1"><span>[</span>74<span>]</span></a></sup>

Matrix addition is defined for two matrices of the same dimensions.

In [modular arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic "Modular arithmetic"), the set of available numbers is restricted to a finite subset of the integers, and addition "wraps around" when reaching a certain value, called the modulus. For example, the set of integers modulo 12 has twelve elements; it inherits an addition operation from the integers that is central to [musical set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory_(music) "Set theory (music)"). The set of integers modulo 2 has just two elements; the addition operation it inherits is known in [Boolean logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_logic "Boolean logic") as the "[exclusive or](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or "Exclusive or")" function. A similar "wrap around" operation arises in [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry"), where the sum of two [angle measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle "Angle") is often taken to be their sum as real numbers modulo 2π. This amounts to an addition operation on the [circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle "Circle"), which in turn generalizes to addition operations on many-dimensional [tori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus "Torus").

The general theory of abstract algebra allows an "addition" operation to be any [associative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative "Associative") and [commutative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative "Commutative") operation on a set. Basic [algebraic structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_structure "Algebraic structure") with such an addition operation include [commutative monoids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_monoid "Commutative monoid") and [abelian groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_group "Abelian group").

### Set theory and category theory

\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Addition&action=edit&section=34 "Edit section: Set theory and category theory")\]

A far-reaching generalization of addition of natural numbers is the addition of [ordinal numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_number "Ordinal number") and [cardinal numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_number "Cardinal number") in set theory. These give two different generalizations of addition of natural numbers to the [transfinite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfinite_number "Transfinite number"). Unlike most addition operations, addition of ordinal numbers is not commutative.<sup id="cite_ref-79"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-79" pcked="1"><span>[</span>77<span>]</span></a></sup> Addition of cardinal numbers, however, is a commutative operation closely related to the [disjoint union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint_union "Disjoint union") operation.

In [category theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory "Category theory"), disjoint union is seen as a particular case of the [coproduct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coproduct "Coproduct") operation,<sup id="cite_ref-80"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-80" pcked="1"><span>[</span>78<span>]</span></a></sup> and general coproducts are perhaps the most abstract of all the generalizations of addition. Some coproducts, such as [direct sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_sum "Direct sum") and [wedge sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedge_sum "Wedge sum"), are named to evoke their connection with addition.

Addition, along with subtraction, multiplication and division, is considered one of the basic operations and is used in [elementary arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_arithmetic "Elementary arithmetic").

[Subtraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtraction "Subtraction") can be thought of as a kind of addition—that is, the addition of an [additive inverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_inverse "Additive inverse"). Subtraction is itself a sort of inverse to addition, in that adding x and subtracting x are [inverse functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_function "Inverse function").

Given a set with an addition operation, one cannot always define a corresponding subtraction operation on that set; the set of natural numbers is a simple example. On the other hand, a subtraction operation uniquely determines an addition operation, an additive inverse operation, and an additive identity; for this reason, an additive group can be described as a set that is closed under subtraction.<sup id="cite_ref-81"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-81" pcked="1"><span>[</span>79<span>]</span></a></sup>

[Multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication "Multiplication") can be thought of as [repeated addition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication_and_repeated_addition "Multiplication and repeated addition"). If a single term x appears in a sum _n_ times, then the sum is the product of _n_ and x. If _n_ is not a [natural number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number "Natural number"), the product may still make sense; for example, multiplication by [−1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E2%88%921_(number) "−1 (number)") yields the [additive inverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_inverse "Additive inverse") of a number.

A circular slide rule

In the real and complex numbers, addition and multiplication can be interchanged by the [exponential function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_function "Exponential function"):<sup id="cite_ref-82"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-82" pcked="1"><span>[</span>80<span>]</span></a></sup>

This identity allows multiplication to be carried out by consulting a [table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_table "Mathematical table") of [logarithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm "Logarithm") and computing addition by hand; it also enables multiplication on a [slide rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slide_rule "Slide rule"). The formula is still a good first-order approximation in the broad context of [Lie groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_group "Lie group"), where it relates multiplication of infinitesimal group elements with addition of vectors in the associated [Lie algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_algebra "Lie algebra").<sup id="cite_ref-83"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-83" pcked="1"><span>[</span>81<span>]</span></a></sup>

There are even more generalizations of multiplication than addition.<sup id="cite_ref-84"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-84" pcked="1"><span>[</span>82<span>]</span></a></sup> In general, multiplication operations always [distribute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributivity "Distributivity") over addition; this requirement is formalized in the definition of a [ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(mathematics) "Ring (mathematics)"). In some contexts, such as the integers, distributivity over addition and the existence of a multiplicative identity is enough to uniquely determine the multiplication operation. The distributive property also provides information about addition; by expanding the product (1 + 1)(_a_ + _b_) in both ways, one concludes that addition is forced to be commutative. For this reason, ring addition is commutative in general.<sup id="cite_ref-85"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-85" pcked="1"><span>[</span>83<span>]</span></a></sup>

[Division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_(mathematics) "Division (mathematics)") is an arithmetic operation remotely related to addition. Since _a_/_b_ = _a_(_b_<sup>−1</sup>), division is right distributive over addition: (_a_ + _b_) / _c_ = _a_/_c_ + _b_/_c_.<sup id="cite_ref-86"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-86" pcked="1"><span>[</span>84<span>]</span></a></sup> However, division is not left distributive over addition; 1 / (2 + 2) is not the same as 1/2 + 1/2.

[Log-log plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-log_plot "Log-log plot") of x + 1 and max (x, 1) from x = 0.001 to 1000<sup id="cite_ref-87"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-87" pcked="1"><span>[</span>85<span>]</span></a></sup>

The maximum operation "max (_a_, _b_)" is a binary operation similar to addition. In fact, if two nonnegative numbers _a_ and _b_ are of different [orders of magnitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude "Orders of magnitude"), then their sum is approximately equal to their maximum. This approximation is extremely useful in the applications of mathematics, for example in truncating [Taylor series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series "Taylor series"). However, it presents a perpetual difficulty in [numerical analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis "Numerical analysis"), essentially since "max" is not invertible. If _b_ is much greater than _a_, then a straightforward calculation of (_a_ + _b_) − _b_ can accumulate an unacceptable [round-off error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-off_error "Round-off error"), perhaps even returning zero. See also _[Loss of significance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_of_significance "Loss of significance")_.

The approximation becomes exact in a kind of infinite limit; if either _a_ or _b_ is an infinite [cardinal number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_number "Cardinal number"), their cardinal sum is exactly equal to the greater of the two.<sup id="cite_ref-88"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-88" pcked="1"><span>[</span>86<span>]</span></a></sup> Accordingly, there is no subtraction operation for infinite cardinals.<sup id="cite_ref-89"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-89" pcked="1"><span>[</span>87<span>]</span></a></sup>

Maximization is commutative and associative, like addition. Furthermore, since addition preserves the ordering of real numbers, addition distributes over "max" in the same way that multiplication distributes over addition:

![{\displaystyle a+\max(b,c)=\max(a+b,a+c).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/384437fddc22e2469471aa11e2c7f01aa0e4a94c)

For these reasons, in [tropical geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_geometry "Tropical geometry") one replaces multiplication with addition and addition with maximization. In this context, addition is called "tropical multiplication", maximization is called "tropical addition", and the tropical "additive identity" is [negative infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_real_number_line "Extended real number line").<sup id="cite_ref-90"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-90" pcked="1"><span>[</span>88<span>]</span></a></sup> Some authors prefer to replace addition with minimization; then the additive identity is positive infinity.<sup id="cite_ref-91"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-91" pcked="1"><span>[</span>89<span>]</span></a></sup>

Tying these observations together, tropical addition is approximately related to regular addition through the [logarithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm "Logarithm"):

![{\displaystyle \log(a+b)\approx \max(\log a,\log b),}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fd67921afb561c010194b42ce859009fb6fd6b15)

which becomes more accurate as the base of the logarithm increases.<sup id="cite_ref-92"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-92" pcked="1"><span>[</span>90<span>]</span></a></sup> The approximation can be made exact by extracting a constant _h_, named by analogy with the [Planck constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant "Planck constant") from [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics"),<sup id="cite_ref-93"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-93" pcked="1"><span>[</span>91<span>]</span></a></sup> and taking the "[classical limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_limit "Classical limit")" as _h_ tends to zero:

![{\displaystyle \max(a,b)=\lim _{h\to 0}h\log(e^{a/h}+e^{b/h}).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/41b8b95005ef0906dc7c542708b0e60c3c0753d1)

In this sense, the maximum operation is a _dequantized_ version of addition.<sup id="cite_ref-94"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-94" pcked="1"><span>[</span>92<span>]</span></a></sup>

Incrementation, also known as the [successor operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Successor_function "Successor function"), is the addition of [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_(number) "1 (number)") to a number.

[Summation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summation "Summation") describes the addition of arbitrarily many numbers, usually more than just two. It includes the idea of the sum of a single number, which is itself, and the [empty sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_sum "Empty sum"), which is [zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0_(number) "0 (number)").<sup id="cite_ref-95"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-95" pcked="1"><span>[</span>93<span>]</span></a></sup> An infinite summation is a delicate procedure known as a [series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_(mathematics) "Series (mathematics)").<sup id="cite_ref-96"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition#cite_note-96" pcked="1"><span>[</span>94<span>]</span></a></sup>
