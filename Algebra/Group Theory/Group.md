#Difinition
$\textbf{Definition 2.1 (A Group)}$: A set $\{G:a,b,c\ldots\}$ is said to form a group if there is an operation $\cdot$, called group multiplication, which associates any given (ordered) pair of elements $a$, $b \in G$ with a well-defined product $a \cdot b$ which is also an element of $G$, such that the following conditions are satisfied:

(i) The operation $\cdot$ is associative, i.e. $a \cdot (b \cdot c) = (a \cdot b) \cdot c$ for all $a$, $b$, $c \in G$;

(ii) Among the elements of $G$, there is an element $e$, called the identity, which has the property that $a \cdot e = a$ for all $a \in G$;

(iii) For each $a \in G$, there is an element $a^{-1} \in G$, called the inverse of $a$, which has the property that $a \cdot a^{-1} = e$.
