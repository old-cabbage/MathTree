#Definition [[Direct Product Vector Space]]
(Direct Product Representation): The [[representation]] $D^{\mu \times \nu}(G)$ defined above on the space W is called the direct product representation of $D^{\mu}(G)$ (on $U$) and $D^{\nu}(G)$ (on $V$).
It is straightforward to verify that the group characters of the direct product representation $D^{\mu \times \nu}$ are equal to the product of the characters of the two representations $D^{\mu}$ and $D^{\nu}$: i.e.$$\chi^{\mu \times \nu} = \chi^{\mu} \chi^{\nu}$$where an implicit class-label (previously denoted by i) is not displayed. Indeed, $\chi^{\mu\times\nu} = \mathrm{Tr}D^{\mu\times\nu}(g) = D^{\mu\times\nu}(g)^k_k = D^{\mu}(g)^i_iD^{\nu}(g)^j_j = \chi^{\mu}\chi^{\nu}$, where $g$ is any group element belonging to the class under consideration. Suppose $D^{\mu}(G)$ and $D^{\nu}(G)$ are irreducible representations of the group $G$ of dimension $n_{\mu}$ and $n_{\nu}$, respectively, then $D^{\mu\times\nu}(G)$ is a representation of dimension $n_{\mu}\times n_{\nu}$, and it is usually reducible. The number of times $a_{\lambda}$ that a given irreducible representation $D^{\lambda}(G)$ occurs in $D^{\mu\times\nu}(G)$ is given by Theorem 3.8: $a^{\mu\times\nu}_{\lambda} = \tilde{\chi}_{\lambda}^{\dagger}\tilde{\chi}^{\mu\times\nu} = \sum_{i}(\chi_{i}^{\lambda})^{*}\chi_{i}^{\mu}\chi_{i}^{\nu}n_{i}/n_{G}$.
