#Lemma:
Two left [[Cosets]] of a subgroup H either coincide completely, or else have no elements in common at all.

$\textbf{Proof: Let }pH$ and $qH$ be the two cosets. Assume $ph_i=qh_j$ for some $h_i,h_j\in H.$ Then $q^{-1}p=h_jh_i^{-1}$ is an element of $H.$ This implies that $q^{-1}pH$ must coincide with $H$, i.e. $q^-1pH=H.$ It follows then $pH=qH.$ Of course, if no $h_i,h_j$ satisfying $ph_{i}=qh_{j}$ exist, then $pH$ and $qH$ must be disjoint by definition. $QED$
