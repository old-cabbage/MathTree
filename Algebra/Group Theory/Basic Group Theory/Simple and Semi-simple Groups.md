#Definition (Simple and Semi-simple Groups): A group is simple if it does not contain any non-trivial [[Invariant Subgroup]]. A group is semi-simple if it does not contain any abelian invariant subgroup.

Examples:(i) The cyclic groups $C_n$ with $n=$prime number are simple groups; (ii) C$_n$ with $n=$non-prime number are neither simple nor semi-simple. For $\mathbf{example,C}_{4}=\{e,a,a^{2},a^{3}\}$ has a subgroup $\{e,a^{2}\}$ which is invariant and abelian; (iii) The group S$_3$ is neither simple nor semi-simple, it has an abelian invariant group $\{ e, ( 123) , ( 321) \} ;$(iv) The three-dimensional rotation group SO(3) is simple, but the two-dimensional rotation group is not.(Surprise?) The latter has an infinite number of abelian invariant subgroups consisting of discrete rotations by angles which are rational fractions of 2Ï€.
